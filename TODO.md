# TODO.md

Four kinds of thing, kept apart.

**Jotted** is for whatever occurs to anyone, a line each, not yet thought through. Add to it freely.

**Waiting on a dependency** is for items waiting on a dependency before they can be implemented.

**Outstanding `.feature` files** are the specifications that have been accepted and not built, in the order they can be built. A file leaves the list when its scenarios pass.

**Known problems** are written out in full — what will go wrong, why it has not yet, and what to do when it does — so they are found where people look, rather than left in a pull request nobody reads again after it merges. A jotted item that turns out to need that much explaining moves down and gets a section of its own.

## Jotted

### /account

- **The profile says nothing of Google.** It does not show whether a Google account is linked, and there is no way to link one other than signing in with Google at the same email address, nor any way to unlink one. Decide whether that is enough, and say so in a feature either way.
- **An account with no password is not told why it cannot change its email address.** Changing it asks for the password, so the page is not offered, but nothing says to set a password first.

### Sending email

- **Infrastructure.** A mail provider for sending real email, and its settings. `FileEmailSender` stands in until then.

### Rotating encryption keys

Depends on: /admin SPA

`AccountKeys.changeSiteKey` re-encrypts every account's key and every queued email with no account for a new `ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, but nothing calls it: a script under `scripts/` is wanted, run with the old key and the new. `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HASH_KEY` cannot be changed at all, since the hash is kept in every registering event; change it and rebuild, and no account is found by its address. Say it is never changed, or keep every key the hash has been made with and find an address by each (from the review of `account-keys`).

### Rebuild read models

Depends on: /admin SPA

Going to use SPA instead of /scripts.

- **A script to rebuild a read model.** `AccountsByEmailAddress.rebuildFrom` makes the table again from every event kept, and only the scenarios call it: `readAll` is on the Postgres store and not on the `EventStore` the application hands out, so nothing in the running site can rebuild anything. SETUP.md §5 says rebuilding is a maintenance script's under `scripts/`; that script is what is missing (from the review of `account-keys`).
